# Champions Onboarding & Debashis Strategy

This short playbook helps select and onboard champions and includes the Debashis approach described in the case study.

Champion selection criteria:
- Tech-comfortable
- Respected by peers
- Natural communicator
- Patient and empathetic
- Balanced skepticism

Champion responsibilities:
- Commit 2 hrs for initial training
- Test new features first and give feedback
- Hold weekly office hours for their peers
- Add good prompts to the team library
- Share 1 success story/month

Onboarding Debashis (skeptic) — sample script:
1) Respect his domain expertise: "You are our best at client relationships; we want your judgment"
2) Offer him "Senior Advisor" role — he reviews Gemini outputs for accuracy
3) Show a quick win in his workflow: Let him ask Gemini to search spec PDFs and find one critical spec; demonstrate time saved (e.g., 45 minutes -> 10 seconds)
4) Pair him with an empathetic champion (Ananya) for peer learning
5) Let him adopt at his own pace; start with spec searches only if he prefers

Communication tips for champions:
- Lead by example: share AI-enabled email examples in team meetings
- Use storytelling: show before/after of actual work saved
- Celebrate small wins and surface errors quickly so trust builds transparently
